Captain's Log:
We are sent on a search and retrieve mission to the Beta Node Star Cluster off Durin 5. Fleet Intelligence has received reports from neighboring way stations of an large 
anomaly orbiting a collapsing star designated Entropy-2. The anomaly is carbon based with the following dimensions. 23 km long and 14 km wide. It's exterior is composed of 
an unknown alloy that envelopes the entire structure tapering off into what looks like an single exhaust drive. We are currently 10 hrs away from the anomaly designated 
CF-101. We haven't received any reports that CF-101 has left Entropy-2's orbit. Although we have to keep in mind that Entropy-2 is a collapsing star and we are at a risk of 
getting caught in it's gravity well. Based on our current velocity and distance from our target. We have a window of 5 hours to search and retrieve CF-101. Our window is 
tight. But I have faith in our crew that we will complete our mission.
